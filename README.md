Commission Calculator
=====================

Windows version of the Commission Price Calculator

The application is made for artists to make it easier for them to calculate the prices of their commissions by having the application do it for them

The application has 2 basic modes:

* Calculate prices based on the price of an additional drawn character/item
* Calculate prices based on how many percent the buyer should save on each additional character/item

Once the artist is done with the basic information, (s)he will be prompted with a file save dialog, which then saves a txt file will a list of the basic prices from 1 to 10 characters/items.
